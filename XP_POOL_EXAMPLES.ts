// XP Pool System - Example Usage and Testing

/**
 * Example: How the XP Pool Depletion System Works
 */

// Scenario: User at Level 3 (daily cap = ~400 XP)
// 1. User has 2 quests (3 points each)
// 2. Both quests should get ~200 XP each (proportional distribution)
// 3. User completes both → gets 400 XP total
// 4. User adds 2 more quests (3 points each)
// 5. New quests get 0 XP (pool depleted)

/**
 * API Usage Examples:
 */

// 1. Check remaining XP pool
// GET /api/quest-instances/xp-pool-status
// Response:
// {
//   "remainingXp": 150,
//   "totalCap": 400,
//   "consumedXp": 250,
//   "percentageUsed": 62
// }

// 2. Complete a quest with pool validation
// PATCH /api/quest-instances/completeQuest
// Body: { "done": true, "id": "quest-123" }
// → XP will be validated against remaining pool

// 3. View today's quests with realistic XP potential
// GET /api/quest-instances/todaysQuests
// → Shows XP rewards respecting remaining daily pool

/**
 * Benefits for Users:
 */

// ✅ Clear XP limits: Users see exactly how much XP they can still earn
// ✅ Encourages early completion: First quests get better rewards
// ✅ No XP loss: Once earned, XP is never taken away
// ✅ Prevents exploitation: Can't exceed daily cap by adding quests later

/**
 * Implementation Notes:
 */

// 1. XP Pool is calculated per user per day
// 2. Only completed quests consume from the pool
// 3. Incomplete quests show potential XP based on remaining pool
// 4. Pool resets daily at user's midnight
// 5. Lateness penalty still applies for late completions
