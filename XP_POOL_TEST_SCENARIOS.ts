// XP Pool System - Test Scenarios

/**
 * Test Scenario 1: Fresh day with multiple quests
 *
 * Setup:
 * - User Level 5 (daily cap = ~500 XP)
 * - 4 quests: 2 completed (3 points each), 2 incomplete (3 points each)
 * - Completed quests earned 125 XP each = 250 XP total consumed
 * - Remaining pool: 500 - 250 = 250 XP
 *
 * Expected Results:
 * - Completed Quest 1: Shows 125 XP (actual earned)
 * - Completed Quest 2: Shows 125 XP (actual earned)
 * - Incomplete Quest 3: Shows 125 XP (potential, 250/2)
 * - Incomplete Quest 4: Shows 125 XP (potential, 250/2)

/**
 * Test Scenario 2: Pool nearly depleted
 *
 * Setup:
 * - User Level 3 (daily cap = ~300 XP)
 * - 3 completed quests earned 280 XP total
 * - Remaining pool: 300 - 280 = 20 XP
 * - 2 new incomplete quests (3 points each)
 *
 * Expected Results:
 * - Completed quests: Show their actual earned XP
 * - Incomplete Quest 1: Shows 10 XP (20/2)
 * - Incomplete Quest 2: Shows 10 XP (20/2)
 * - Total potential: 20 XP (respects remaining pool)

/**
 * Test Scenario 3: Pool completely depleted
 *
 * Setup:
 * - User Level 2 (daily cap = ~200 XP)
 * - Completed quests earned 200 XP total
 * - Remaining pool: 0 XP
 * - 3 new incomplete quests added
 *
 * Expected Results:
 * - All incomplete quests: Show 0 XP
 * - Message: "Daily XP limit reached"
 */

/**
 * Key Improvements:
 */

// ✅ Completed quests show actual earned XP (not 0)
// ✅ Incomplete quests show realistic potential XP
// ✅ Potential XP respects remaining daily pool
// ✅ Users see exactly what they can still earn
// ✅ No false promises of XP that can't be awarded
